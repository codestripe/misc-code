# Sample Code

<p>I have added these two code pieces for the time being as they were the quickest to upload
and don't require a lot of setup to get running.</p>

<p>The SMS class was something that was quick to program but has proved invaluable
in paving the way to sending bulk emails and such with little alteration.</p>

<p>The Flappy bird project was just something I coded in my spare time to get familiar
with object oriented programming in JS and also to get familiar with canvas.</p>

<p>There are other projects that I would like to upload and will do so in due course.</p>
