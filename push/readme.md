## Push Notification Demo Application##

This entire app allows you to download the Android app to a smartphone. Once the app is downloaded, a user can open the app on their smartphone and register for the push notification service.

Once they are subscribed and registered to the service, over the air push notifications can be sent to them.

A demo link has been created with a working version of the application. This can be viewed at: [http://vikeer.org/push/](http://vikeer.org/push/ "http://vikeer.org/push/"). Once there, the smartphone app can be downloaded and a user will can be registered on the system. If [http://vikeer.org/push/](http://vikeer.org/push/ "http://vikeer.org/push/") is reloaded, provided the registration was successful, a message can be sent from the control panel.
